# Flappy Bird
## Created by Nadya, Kynan, and Henry
### Original Game by Dong Nguyen

Project description: The project is a simple implementation of the popular game "Flappy Bird," where the user controls a bird by clicking or pressing the space bar to avoid obstacles and score points.

Technical guide: The program requires Java 17 and the Kilt Graphics library. The main class is "FlappyBird" in the "flappybird" package. To run the program, simply compile and run the "FlappyBird.java" file, which will open a new window and start the game. The game will start when the user clicks the mouse or presses the space bar.

Acknowledgments: The implementation is based on the Macalester College CS department's Flappy Bird implementation.


Regarding design limitations, there are no fundamental issues in the code, but there are some areas that could be improved.

One improvement could ..

In terms of specific bugs or glitches, the code is functional, but some potential issues could arise depending on the user's environment. For example, the game may not run properly if the image resources are not located in the correct directory. Another issue could be the responsiveness of the game, which may depend on the user's hardware and processing power.
